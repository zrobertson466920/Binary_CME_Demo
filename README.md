## Overview

The **Binary Classifier Metric Elicitation Demo** is an interactive Streamlit application inspired by the research paper "[Performance Metric Elicitation from Pairwise Classifier Comparisons](#)" by Gaurushh and Koyejo. This demo showcases how to determine the optimal decision threshold for a binary classifier through pairwise comparisons of different threshold classifiers.

Instead of relying solely on predefined metrics, this tool allows users to:

- **Automate** the comparison process based on standard metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
- **Interactively** compare classifier thresholds and select preferences to infer the optimal threshold.

This approach provides a flexible framework for understanding and optimizing classifier performance tailored to specific preferences or objectives.

## Features

- **Dataset Overview**: Explore the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset used for binary classification.
- **Classifier Performance**: View performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) across different decision thresholds.
- **Pairwise Comparisons**:
  - **Automated**: Compare classifiers based on selected metrics.
  - **User-Driven**: Manually compare classifier thresholds and select preferences.
- **Optimal Threshold Elicitation**: Determine the most preferred threshold based on comparisons.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive ROC Curve and preference counts bar chart.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive Streamlit UI for seamless interaction.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python package installer. It typically comes bundled with Python.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metric_elicitation_demo.git
   cd metric_elicitation_demo
   ```

   *(Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username if applicable.)*

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you can install the necessary packages directly:*

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib
   ```

### Running the App

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Ensure you're in the root directory of the project.

   ```bash
   cd metric_elicitation_demo
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run metric_elicitation_demo.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application**

   After running the above command, Streamlit will launch the app in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with its features as follows:

### Automated Pairwise Comparisons

1. **Select Comparison Type**

   - Navigate to the sidebar on the left.
   - Choose **"Automated"** as the comparison type.

2. **Choose a Metric**

   - From the dropdown, select a performance metric (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall) to base the pairwise comparisons.

3. **View Results**

   - **Dataset Overview**: Understand the dataset's composition.
   - **Classifier Performance**: See how different thresholds affect performance metrics.
   - **Pairwise Comparisons**: View automated comparisons based on the selected metric.
   - **Preference Counts**: Visualize how often each threshold was preferred.
   - **Optimal Threshold**: Identify the most preferred threshold.
   - **ROC Curve**: Examine the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

### User-Driven Pairwise Comparisons

1. **Select Comparison Type**

   - Navigate to the sidebar on the left.
   - Choose **"User-Driven"** as the comparison type.

2. **Compare Thresholds**

   - For each pair of thresholds, review their performance metrics.
   - Select your preferred threshold using the radio buttons provided.

3. **View Results**

   - **Preference Counts**: See how your selections influence the preference counts.
   - **Optimal Threshold**: Determine the threshold that best aligns with your preferences.
   - **ROC Curve**: Analyze the classifier's performance.
